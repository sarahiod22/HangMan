I spent two and a half hours on the challenge. 

I used C++ and my code runs on the command line 

My code first checks that the input is a letter, so no numbers or special characters are accepted.
Afterward, converts the letter to lowercase so that both uppercase and lowercase letters work.
Also, if the word has a repeated letter (2+), the user will have to guess each one separately. Each input counts toward one letter of the word only. 
If the user has already guessed the number of times that a letter is present in a word, any additional submission of that same letter counts toward incorrect guesses.

For the list of words, I decided to use an array, but I could have used a vector because I'm not really manipulating/working with that list.
For the list of incorrectly guessed letters, I used a vector because it is easier to add elements at the end.
For the list of correctly guessed letters, I used an array because I know from the beginning the size of the array (the same as the size of the word being guessed) and I'm not adding or removing items.

I decided to create a class named HangMan with .h and .cpp files because I think that it can be represented as a separate object with functions that help to solve the game.
Also, so that main.cpp stays easy to understand.
